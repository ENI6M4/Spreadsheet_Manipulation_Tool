# Java

Well lads
Said I'd create this cos it's handy and everyone else is doing it so


I think we should split this project into 6 classes(dermot did 1 for us originally had 7 in) and combine at end

Now I'm not sure how to go about this we should talk bout it next time we all meet up but I think

We should do 2 each and whoever does none(whoever got highest in test - not me anyways thats for sure) will finish the classes
when we got them down to 80-90% cos thats the trickiest part

and if we're still stuck we'll look over it as a team
(or ..............) lol 
jk


whatever we do I definetly think we should get this out of the way
